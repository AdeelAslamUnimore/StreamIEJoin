# SPO-Join: Efficient Distrubuted Stream Inequality Join
# Stream Inequality Join in Distributed Stream Processing Systems

Stream Inequality Join is a fundamental operation but can be computationally expensive due to the regular insertion and updating of tuples within a bounded set of streaming data. It plays a crucial role in scenarios where real-time analysis and correlation of diverse streams of data are required. Distributed Stream Processing Systems offer an efficient and scalable environment for handling complex streaming operations like Inequality Join. These systems distribute the computation across multiple nodes, allowing for parallel processing and better performance in handling large volumes of streaming data. Due to the computational intensity of Stream Inequality Join, it's crucial to carefully design and optimize your queries to achieve the desired performance levels.
